## Why a store?
I was a student on a udemy course about C# and Angular. And the example was a e-commerce. But the teacher code was terrible. Then So, I translated the code to English and I'm cleaning the code (this is in processes). Stores, in general way, have a medium difficulty on bussiness rules. So, will be fun to trainning this. Except the payment mechanism, I hope to implement everything.

## C# 

I choose C# because I'm interested in jobs with this language and I'm studying for MCSA certification.
If you look close at this code, you will perceive some overengineering on it. This is proposital. I want to training my architectural skills in a more complex scenario. Of course, I will did not use some of strategies in this code regularly - except if necesserie.

## Angular?
Unfortunately front-end and UX is not (yet) are not my area. So, I have coded this front in Angular just to have a front-end experience to test my application.
Besides, I do wanna understantd the dificulties involving the front-end consumering of API's and to perpect the best practices/opportunties to reduce the number of transactions.

So, is not the best user experience. Sorry.
